-- LOOPS KIND IN HASKELL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All loops in Haskell can be decribed through recursion and an eventual accumulator, to replace
the "i" accumulator.

However, it is better to "avoid" explicit recursion as much as possible.
It is reccomended to use the constructs that Haskell provides to solve the most common kind of
loops:

  * map:
    map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
    useful for embarassingly parallel loops. "map" takes a function and applies it to all
    elements of a list.

  * filter:
    filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
    go through a list (for loop) and search (return) elements which satisfy a specific criteria

  * fold (foldl and foldr):
    foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
    do something to every element of a list, one element after the other. While we do it, we
    update an accumulator using some kind of logic, and at the end we return the accumulator.
    E.g. go thorugh each element of a list and depending on the value of the element decide
    what to do...
    
    NOTE: fold is very powerful and differs from filter in the sense that:
    	  - filter goes through list, and evaluates all elements of the input list thorugh a
	    Bool function. If the function returns True, it ADDs the elem to the returned list.
	  - fold goes through list, and evaluates all elements of the input list thorugh a
	    custom function, which uses the accumulator and returns the same type of the accumulator.
	    In addition, fold does not return a list, but a single element. 

In all other cases (or when we cannot recognize/apply one of the 3 functions described above),
we can use recursion + accumulator.

-- WHY HASKELL HAS NO LOOPS?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Haskell is a DECLARATIVE language => does not require loops.

Declarative vs Imperative:

	* DECLARATIVE language: describe WHAT to do => does not require loops

	* IMPERATIVE language: describe HOW to do something => requires loops

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- NOTE THE IMPORTANCE OF step FUNCTIONS IN HASKELL LOOPS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples:
dlts :: String -> [String]
dlts = foldr step [] . lines -- note [] is the initial value for the accumulator in foldr
  where step firstline accumulator
          | "#define DLT_" `isPrefixOf` firstline = secondWord firstline : accumulator
          | otherwise = accumulator
        secondWord = head . tail . words -- function to return the 2nd word inside of 1st_line,
                     -- for example, if 1st_line is "#define DLT_1 1 /'define #1", it returns
                     -- DLT_1
-- *Main> dlts "#define HA 1 // random\n#define DLT_2 2 /'define #2*/\n"
-- ["DLT_2"]
