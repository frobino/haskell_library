NOTE:
	- all datatypes names start with Capital letter

* Char
* String
* Bool
* Int (32 bit on 32 bit machines, 64 on 64 bits...)
* Integer (Unbounded size. More expensive than Int but never ovf)
* Double (typically 64 bits)

* Maybe (with Just and Nothing)
  to use maybe we define a variable with Just, e.g:
  let v = Just "something"
  in this way v can be a [Char] or Nothing

* lists:
  [1,2,3,4]
  ['h','i']
  "hi"
* tuples
  (True, "hello")

FUNCTION OVER LISTS:
* head
* tail
* drop
* fst
* snd
